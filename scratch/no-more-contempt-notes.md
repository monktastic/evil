Now, I need to be very clear about two things. First, in any given situation, there may indeed be people being victimized and others who are perpetrating â€” and obviously the way we treat each should differ. But seeing these roles as intrinsic to the people only ensures that we will perpetuate that dynamic (though possibly with the roles reversed, in due time).
