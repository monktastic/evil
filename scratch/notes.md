### Part 1: Evil as mental illness

1. Evil is best understood as a form of mental illness.
2. Once this is seen clearly, it is obvious that contempt for "bad people" is harmful: it only exacerbates the underlying condition.
3. Even once we understand this, contempt still _feels_ right. Why?
4. If you introspect carefully enough (and this is _hard_), you will discover something shocking:
    - Part of you can perceive the aspect of their mind that wishes to be free of evil.
    - It _knows_ that your contempt will only compound it.
    - It takes _pleasure_ in their suffering, but convinces you that this is righteous.
5. This is _evil_. Not in the abstract: you can _taste_ the malevolence from here.
6. It is only upon tasting it that you truly understand how "bad people" are able to do what they do. And you cannot fix what you don't understand.
7. That is why you can only fight evil to the degree that you recognize your own contempt as evil.
8. The less you do, the more you are certainly leaking evil somewhere, somehow, in some way that you are hiding from yourself...

### Part 2: Self-deception and the evil conspiracy

1. Have you ever done something that deep down you felt was wrong, but convinced yourself it was okay? Really try to recall what that state was like. You knew perfectly well that what you were doing was wrong, but that knowledge was carefully hidden from conscious self-reflection. This is **self-deception**.
   - The part that knows its wrong is your **conscience** (not to be confused with "consciousness"). It is the voice of the deepest aspect of mind.
2. This mechanism is ultimately responsible for _all_ misbehavior. 
    - Even the most evil person could not do what they do without it.
    - Conversely, you yourself are capable of almost anything under the right circumstances.
3. The more you engage in self-deception, the less you can hear your conscience, until you don't even remember that you have one. Evil feels increasingly natural.
    - It is a spectrum; there is no fixed dividing line separating "good" and "bad" people.
    - The conscience itself never disappears or changes. This is the sense in which nobody is "fundamentally" morally defective (the basis of contempt).
4. Once you see this clearly, you don't see "evil" in other people; you see self-deception.
    - When you hear a lying, hypocritical CEO / politician / banker etc., part of them _knows_ that they are lying, which makes you (rightfully) angry. At the same time, that knowledge is carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection, and contempt just forces it further underground.
5. You begin to detect subtle self-deception in all kinds of places that you wouldn't have described (or recognized) as "evil" before, but you now see it's the same phenomenon.
6. Evil almost appears like an intelligent organism that lives in our minds and manipulates us into committing evil while convincing us that we're fighting it. It is _insanely_ clever. 
7. Stepping back, it begins to appear more like a _distributed_ organism: your evil triggers mine, etc. It communicates with itself through the vast network of human minds, leveraging our collective intelligence to keep itself alive and growing.
    - Every time you feel contempt, malice, hatred, etc., you are feeding the Beast.
8. You discover that your contempt for "bad people" isn't just to see _them_ suffer: the evil in your mind knows that they will in turn make _others_ suffer, etc.
9. This is that archetypal "global evil conspiracy"; the one to which all the rest ultimately filter up. It is not run by a select group of evil people, but by the evil in _all of our minds together_. 
    - We are the hardware on which the Devil himself runs.
    - **Your enemy is not other people, but the evil in _all_ of our minds.**
    - There may well be groups of "evil" people who conspire to cause great harm, but their existence wouldn't be possible if the rest of us weren't feeding the source — and conversely, it is _inevitable_ given that we are.
10. What does it "want"? Various kinds of Armageddon. 
     - This is why the US is headed toward civil war, with nobody aware of their own complicity. 
     - It is also what [leads to bitter divorces](https://www.gottman.com/blog/this-one-thing-is-the-biggest-predictor-of-divorce/), in which each side feels like the exclusive victim / hero.

### Part 3: The light at the end of the tunnel

1. Reality is actually one seamless interdependent whole.
   - When you see this, you see yourself in everyone and everything.
   - It is not realized fully until enlightenment, but everyone can sense it at all times.
   - From this place, contempt and malice are impossible.
2. Ultimately, all self-knowledge boils down to hiding the fact that what happens to the world ultimately happens to you, because you _are_ the world.
3. This is what enables dehumanization and objectification — the very roots of genocide.
    - When you meet someone in this state, you can practically _see_ the evil in their eyes.
    - Similarly, when you feel contempt, that is how others perceive _you._ No wonder it backfires.
4. This means that all evil is ultimately rooted in a simple misperception.
5. The ultimate nature of your mind is pure compassion; absolute goodness. This is your "inner light."
6. "Long ago," you lost touch with your absolute goodness.
    - From this arose the fear that you may _not_ be good.
    - Instead of confronting that fear, you projected it outward, seeing _others_ as evil. 
    - This gave you something to vanquish to prove your own goodness beyond doubt.
    - Unfortunately it just ended up making you feel even _more_ guilty, forcing you to project even harder.
    - Thus began a horrifying cycle that continues to this day.
7. When is "long ago," exactly? This is the hardest part to explain.
    - What you perceive as "reality" is actually a kind of hallucination.
    - Space and time are constructs _within_ that hallucination.
    - So the hallucination itself did not start at a particular point in "time," exactly.
    - You only see "other people" because you're still projecting your own guilt.
8. That may all be hard to accept, but the upshot is that the way to overcome the "evil" in your own mind is to return to your "inner light." That is the spiritual path in a nutshell.
9. The more you do this, the more easily you perceive the true inner and outer conditions that lead to any misbehavior, which enables a healthy response; one that does not amplify evil in the world.

### Compassion

1. Compassion does not mean being nice. It doesn't have to take any particular form. It is simply about being in touch with your "inner light"; free of self-deception.
   - Sometimes it involves being sweet and loving.
   - Other times, it must be fierce or even violent.
2. Other people are _ridiculously_ sensitive to our motivations. "Benevolent" violence has a very different long-term result than malicious violence.
    - This may not be obvious to the untrained eye.

Any civilized person knows that we're not supposed to lose our humanity in the face of evil. But do we know _why?_

The world's religious and secular ethical systems give us good reasons, but in the "moment of truth" we're not relying on intellectual answers. There's something else within us that _knows_ that inhumanity is wrong[^synonyms], and we get to decide whether to listen or not. It may not even know what the "humane" decision *is*, but it knows that it's right.

It never appears to our mind as "I choose to do the wrong thing."

Religions answer that it's roughly the voice of God, but many don't find that satisfying. In fact, that may even be a strike _against_ it, given how well "God told me to do it" has worked out for humanity.

Instead of answering such questions, a more practical question is "how can I "

Preparing to go against your conscience.

[^synonyms] And not just because they're synonyms.

I think we can all agree that we don't want to be doing things that we know to be wrong. But:

- We do them far more often than we realize.
- The cumulative effect is far worse than we realize.

Attempt to provoke.

When I witness you being evil, I feel compelled to be a little evil in response.

---

Contempt is a sign that your mind is preparing to do something wrong that it will convince you is right. It is putting you into the trance. That's all it is.

In any given situation, there may indeed be people being victimized and others who are perpetrating — and obviously the way we treat each should differ. But seeing these roles as intrinsic to the people only ensures that we will perpetuate that dynamic (though possibly with the roles reversed, in due time).
