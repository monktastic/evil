Any civilized person knows that we're not supposed to lose our humanity in the face of evil. But do we know _why?_

The world's religious and secular ethical systems give us good reasons, but in the "moment of truth" we're not relying on intellectual answers. There's something else within us that _knows_ that inhumanity is wrong[^synonyms], and we get to decide whether to listen or not. It may not even know what the "humane" decision *is*, but it knows that it's right.

It never appears to our mind as "I choose to do the wrong thing."

Religions answer that it's roughly the voice of God, but many don't find that satisfying. In fact, that may even be a strike _against_ it, given how well "God told me to do it" has worked out for humanity.

Instead of answering such questions, a more practical question is "how can I "

Preparing to go against your conscience.

[^synonyms] And not just because they're synonyms.

I think we can all agree that we don't want to be doing things that we know to be wrong. But:

- We do them far more often than we realize.
- The cumulative effect is far worse than we realize.

Attempt to provoke.

When I witness you being evil, I feel compelled to be a little evil in response.

Contempt is a sign that your mind is preparing to do something wrong that it will convince you is right. It is putting you into the trance. That's all it is.

In any given situation, there may indeed be people being victimized and others who are perpetrating â€” and obviously the way we treat each should differ. But seeing these roles as intrinsic to the people only ensures that we will perpetuate that dynamic (though possibly with the roles reversed, in due time).
