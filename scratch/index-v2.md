title: Contempt is Evil
---

TL;DR:

- Contempt for "bad people" is an attempt to harm the world cleverly disguised as an attempt to help it.
- We only behave that way due to a misperception—the very _same_ misperception that causes their misbehavior in the first place.
- Acting on our misperception strengthens theirs—and thus increases their capacity for evil. 
- A deep part of us _knows_ that we're doing this, but shields it from consciousness. It does this to justify its misperception, because the more evil they become, the more justified our contempt.

Reality is one seamless interdependent whole. Upon realizing this, you literally see yourself in everyone and everything. From here, contempt and malice are impossible. Realizing this fully is enlightenment, but everyone can sense it at all times, even if only subconsciously.

All evil stems from the illusion that we are fundamentally separate. It is what enables us to objectify and dehumanize — the very roots of genocide. But even while people engage in atrocities, the very deepest part of them knows that it's based on a lie. It is a profound kind of self-deception.

We are all familiar with a milder form of the same mechanism. Self-deception is what enables us to justify minor misbehaviors that deep down we feel are wrong. The vast majority of our self-deception is not consciously recognized as such, but some part always knows.

Actions taken from this place harm the world — although this is not always obvious from the immediate (or even second- or third-order) effects.

Contempt for "bad people" is one such behavior. If you inspect your mind carefully enough, you'll find that it exists to distance yourself from them, because their self-deception subconsciously reminds you of your own. (This is why a mind free of misperception never feels contempt.) Treating them with contempt is just _more_ self-deception.

Even though you don't recognize this as self-deception, they do, and this reinforces theirs: they now see _you_ as a "bad person" and feel compelled to return the favor. You act dismayed, but part of you _wants_ this, because it justifies your misperception of them. The effects of this behavior will ripple out into the world, darkening it.

That's all contempt is: an attempt to reinforce a particular delusion; one that lies at the root of all evil. We tell ourselves that we are "fighting evil," but the deepest part of us knows that our behavior is secretly designed to create more, so that we may continue hiding from what lurks within.

This process begins long before it manifests in our behavior. Notice the deep tendency to seek evil "out there." It's why revenge fantasy films like The Equalizer exist. The whole point is to take attention away from what's going on inside by fixating our attention outward.
