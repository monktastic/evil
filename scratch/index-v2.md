title: Contempt is Evil
---

Reality is one seamless interdependent whole. Upon realizing this, you literally see yourself in everyone and everything. From there, contempt and malice are impossible. This isn't uncovered fully until enlightenment, but everyone can sense it at all times, even if only subconsciously.

All evil stems from the illusion that we are fundamentally separate. This is what enables people to objectify and dehumanize — attitudes that enable atrocities. When we meet someone in the grip of that illusion, we perceive them as evil, which in turn provokes _our_ capacity for evil.

Similarly, when we treat others with contempt, they cannot help but perceive _us_ as a little bit evil, which provokes theirs. If you inspect your mind carefully enough, you will discover that some part of you actually _intended_ to provoke theirs, because that justifies your contempt. Yet consciously, you will feel like you're "fighting evil."

From a certain angle, it appears as though _evil itself_ is manipulating us into provoking it in each other while convincing us that we're fighting it. If you step back a bit, it begins to look like a distributed organism, communicating with itself through the vast network of human minds and leveraging our collective intelligence.

You know the archetypal "evil global conspiracy" that is said to be running the world behind the scenes, without anyone ever detecting it? Well _this is it._ It's not run by a select group of evil people; it is run by the evil in _all of our minds together_. **We** are the hardware on which the Devil runs.

What does it feel like when this sinister organism is trying to take control of your mind? _Contempt._ If it succeeds, it will convince you that your true enemy is not _it_, but the human standing before you. It won't just _tell_ you this; it will manipulate your very perception until you are sure of it.

This may be hard to swallow, but it's absolutely crucial to see — because only once you see it will you understand the trick by which evil commandeers _other_ minds. And you cannot fix what you don't understand. Until then, you cannot help but spread evil even as you're sure you're fighting it.

But even while people engage in atrocities, the very deepest part of them knows that it's based on a lie. It is a profound kind of self-deception.

We are all familiar with a milder form of the same mechanism. Self-deception is what enables us to justify minor misbehaviors that deep down we feel are wrong. The vast majority of our self-deception is not consciously recognized as such, but some part always knows.

Actions taken from this place harm the world — although this is not always obvious from the immediate (or even second- or third-order) effects.

Contempt for "bad people" is one such behavior. If you inspect your mind carefully enough, you'll find that it exists to distance yourself from them, because their self-deception subconsciously reminds you of your own. (This is why a mind free of misperception never feels contempt.) Treating them with contempt is just _more_ self-deception.

Even though you don't recognize this as self-deception, they do, and this reinforces theirs: they now see _you_ as a "bad person" and feel compelled to return the favor. You act dismayed, but part of you _wants_ this, because it justifies your misperception of them. The effects of this behavior will ripple out into the world, darkening it.

That's all contempt is: an attempt to reinforce a particular delusion; one that lies at the root of all evil. We tell ourselves that we are "fighting evil," but the deepest part of us knows that our behavior is secretly designed to create more, so that we may continue hiding from what lurks within.

This process begins long before it manifests in our behavior. Notice the deep tendency to seek evil "out there." It's why revenge fantasy films like The Equalizer exist. The whole point is to take attention away from what's going on inside by fixating our attention outward.
