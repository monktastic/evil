Have you ever done something that deep down you felt was wrong, but convinced yourself it was okay? You knew perfectly well that what you were doing was wrong—according to your own conscience—but that knowledge was carefully hidden from conscious self-reflection. You somehow _knew_ but simultaneously _didn't_. This is self-deception. Really try to recall what that state was like.

If a stranger were to treat you with contempt right then, would that alleviate the state or only deepen it? I don't just mean that they show you "tough love" (which can actually help), but treat you as though you're _fundamentally_ defective. You couldn't help but feel contempt in return, with a sense of "you don't know me, so GTFO."

We imagine that something different happens when we treat _other_ people with contempt, but it's fundamentally the same; only the details differ. A "bad person" may be so far removed from their conscience that they don't even remember that they have one, but the desire to return the contempt happens for essentially the same reason. This _deepens_ their self-deception.

One definition of contempt is the feeling that "if I were you, I wouldn't be making the despicable choices that you are." Logically, this is false: if you were in the totality of their circumstances, you would do as they do — and feel equally justified. But somehow that's not enough to dissolve the contempt. If you try to _imagine_ what it's like to be them, you will always superimpose some of your qualities on them, which is a different thing altogether. And if you just take it as a tautology, that's not very helpful either.

But there are conditions under which it is possible to get a taste of what it is like to be them. One of those is enlightenment, which unfortunately is not something you can just turn on. Another is certain psychedelic experiences.

As crazy as this sounds, you can have (what feels exactly like) the full experience of _being_ an evil person
