title: Contempt is Evil
---

There really _is_ a sort of "evil conspiracy" responsible for the world's ills. What makes it so hard to nail is that part of it lives within our own minds—and we are secretly giving it safe harbor.

---

Imagine you witness someone misbehaving—anything from cutting in line to a full-blown atrocity.

If your mind were free of evil, you would literally see yourself in them—indeed, in everyone and everything[^literature]—and be incapable of contempt or malice. You would more easily perceive the inner and outer conditions that led to their behavior, which would enable a healthy response; one that would not amplify hostility in the world. This is called compassion—_even if it requires violence_[^dalai-lama-gun]. It _reduces_ evil.

Evil, on the other hand, alters your very perception, so that you literally see "bad person" and wish to cause harm. It might be as innocent as mockery or shaming[^mockery]—but however "well-intentioned," such behavior is subconsciously designed to create *more* enmity; to increase evil in the world. But this fact will be cleverly hidden from you. You will come away feeling righteous; like you "fought evil."

This self-deception is incredibly difficult to detect in ourselves. Yet without seeing it, the true reason for other people's misbehavior remains forever hidden from us, and we cannot help but exacerbate it.

If you still harbor the capacity for contempt (and I certainly do), then you are surely leaking evil into the world somewhere, somehow, in some way that you are not yet conscious of. The greatest thing you can do for the world is heal the part of you that's enabling this. Meditation, psychedelics, trauma work, shadow work, whatever. Please don't let it fester.

You don't have to take my word for it. Part of you knows this perfectly well. You only need to discover what's blocking that knowledge from being fully conscious.

## Footnotes

[^dalai-lama-gun]: The Dalai Lama was once asked what you should do if a gunman is trying to shoot you and you have a gun. [He said "shoot back."](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/)

[^mockery]: There is a subtlety here: just like with violence, mocking or shaming *can* sometimes be the right response. But they work (and feel) entirely differently when not motivated by contempt. I think of these as advanced techniques, because it's so easy to fool oneself.

[^literature]:
    - [The Egg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fcK_fRYaI): A short story by Andy Weir and animated by Kurzgesagt.
    - [Please Call Me By My True Names](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fcK_fRYaI), a poem by Thich Nhat Hanh.
    - > Even if I want to put this realization down I can’t. Sometimes it’s excruciating. You know those morons that rammed those planes into the World Trade Center? That was me. The people that died in the collapse. Me again. Every single person who ever paid money for a Pet Rock? Me. I don’t mean I identify with them or sympathize with them. I mean I _am_ them. It’s impossible to explain any more clearly than that, but this isn’t a figure of speech or bad poetry. I mean it absolutely literally.
    >
    > But the universe is sooooo much bigger than any of that. The sky is me, and the stars too, and the chirping crickets and the songs they make; sparkling rivers, snow and rain, distant solar systems and whatever beings may live there: it’s all me. And it’s you, too.
    >
    > — Zen priest (and punk rocker) Brad Warner

[^distributed-organism]: I asked ChatGPT how it would interpret this phrase. I loved its response:
    > Describing evil as a "distributed organism" suggests a conceptual metaphor where evil is likened to a living entity with multiple parts functioning cohesively but spread out over a wide area or among various systems. In this metaphor, just as an organism has many cells or systems that work together to sustain life, evil could be seen as having various components or individuals that contribute to its overall presence or influence.
    >
    >This idea implies that evil is not centralized or localized in one place or person but is instead dispersed throughout a society, group, or even within various aspects of human nature or interaction. It suggests that evil might operate through a network of actions, attitudes, and individuals, all contributing to the maintenance or spread of its effects, much like a biological organism's systems and cells contribute to its survival and functioning.
    >
    > It also can imply a sense of resilience and adaptability; just as an organism can survive damage to one part by relying on others, a "distributed organism" of evil might not be easily eradicated because its diffuse nature allows it to continue functioning even if one aspect is addressed or reformed.

[^conspiracy]: Our cumulative self-deception effectively _compels_ the existence of evil people running the show, on whom our externalized blame can be entirely pinned. Which isn't to say that we shouldn't hold them fully responsible for their actions—just that if we do it with contempt, we are secretly instructing reality to immediately fill the shoes. All that changes is the details of their evil.
