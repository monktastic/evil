Nobody _wants_ to be depressed. Or rather, people may act like they do, and even say that they do — in which case it is probably kindest to believe them — but the very deepest aspect of their mind simply _couldn't_ want such a thing if it could see clearly what it was choosing. A person may recognize this only after being free of it, and look back on it like a bizarre dream.

It wasn't until recently that empathy for depression became a social norm. Until then, contempt seemed to many like a perfectly healthy response, and sympathy was equated with coddling. Today, we know it's more nuanced: depending on the person and situation, either firmness or gentleness may be appropriate — but in neither case does an underlying attitude of contempt help anything.

Advances in neuroscience certainly helped drive this cultural shift, but were they really necessary? Once we knew that brains and genes were a thing, did we really need to know the exact details to feel empathy for the depressed? Did anyone ever doubt that it had _some_ physiological basis? Anyone "with the eyes to see" could directly perceive that contempt was the wrong approach. It served only to make the attacker feel superior, and it was harmful.

The same is true for alcoholism, addiction, obesity, and countless other conditions. It seems we have to re-learn the same lesson each time, using new science as justification — but it is always possible to see that the deepest aspect of our mind simply couldn't want to suffer. This "empathy shortcut" makes it clear that contempt makes zero sense in such situations. Our descendants will surely wonder how this wasn't obvious from the start.

What may be harder to see is that the base layer of our mind also doesn't want _others_ to suffer. People certainly act like they want this, and even sometimes say that they do — in which case it is dangerously naive not to believe them — but something surprisingly similar is going on beneath the surface. Their confused state is generated by a haze of profound delusion that will horrify them should they manage to break free of it. I do not have the neuroscience to prove this to you (yet), but it is plain for anyone with the eyes to see. It is not merely a belief.

Contempt for "bad people" makes zero sense for exactly the same reason as before: it merely compounds the delusion that's causing the problem to begin with. They are simply under the sway of a different form of mental illness. Our contempt doesn't exist to help anyone; it just helps us feel superior. The very deepest part of us knows this, but that knowledge somehow isn't reaching our conscious awareness.

Social norms have largely (and thankfully) robbed us of our ability to feel superior when treating mentally ill people (or mentally retarded people, or those with different skin color, ...) with contempt. People who do that are rightfully seen as wrong in the head themselves. But then we turn right around and treat _them_ with contempt — unable to see that we are repeating the same fundamental mistake.

If you don't yet have the "eyes to see" this, then it may sound hopelessly naive. But the truth is that the very deepest layer of your mind _cannot want to feel contempt for **anyone**_. If you could clearly see the choice you were making, you wouldn't make it. It is only tempting when in the grip of profound delusion. You may *say* that you want it, and deeply believe that it's helpful, but there will (hopefully) come a time when you are horrified by this confusion.

Just like you can't talk people out of depression, addiction, or evil, I can't talk you out of contempt[^talk-you-out]. Something must be _seen_.

Now, an important clarification: in the same way that we might need to be firm with someone with mental illness, we may need to be even more firm — perhaps even violent[^dalai-lama-gun] — with people who "want" to cause harm. Our response may even *look* like contempt. But *genuine* contempt comes from a completely different source; a deeply malicious one. They should not be confused.

It can be very hard to see how this change in motivation makes any difference. After all, violence is violence, right? But it's not. People are _ridiculously_ sensitive to our intentions, and malice generates very different long-term consequences than benevolence. This difference may not be obvious from the immediate (or even second- or third-order) effects, but again, it is visible to those with eyes to see.

When all desire for harm (for oneself and others) is eliminated from the mind, what remains isn't apathy or neutrality. Surprisingly, it is an impossibly fierce and uncompromising love for the world — one that is able to deal with all kinds of situations in a healthy way[^jesus].

My hope for humanity is that we discover this. I believe our very existence depends on it.

[^talk-you-out]: But I might as well try: stop feeling contempt, jackass. There, I bet that worked.

[^dalai-lama-gun]: The Dalai Lama was once asked what you should do if a gunman is trying to shoot you and you have a gun. [He said "shoot back."](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/)

[^jesus]: This is what guys like Jesus and Buddha realized (and many gals, too). They weren't suppressing the tendency for malice and contempt; they were simply free of the profound illness that enables them. I'm sure they didn't see themselves as "good people"; they were probably grateful to finally be mentally healthy. When we fancy ourselves virtuous for hating the "bad guys" in defense of the "good guys," we are desecrating the profound legacy they left us.
