title: Contempt is Evil
---

There really _is_ a sort of "evil conspiracy" responsible for the world's ills. What makes it so hard to nail is that part of it lives within our own minds—and we are secretly giving it safe harbor.

---

Imagine you witness someone misbehaving—anything from cutting in line to a full-blown atrocity.

If your mind were free of evil, you would literally see yourself in them—indeed, in everyone and everything[^literature]—and be incapable of contempt or malice. You would more easily perceive the inner and outer conditions that led to their behavior, which would enable a healthy response; one that would not amplify hostility in the world. This is called compassion—_even if it requires violence_[^dalai-lama-gun]. It _reduces_ evil.

Evil, on the other hand, alters your very perception, so that you literally see "bad person" and wish to cause harm. It might be as innocent as mockery or shaming[^mockery]—but however "well-intentioned," such behavior is subconsciously designed to create *more* enmity; to increase evil in the world. But this fact will be cleverly hidden from you. You will come away feeling righteous; like you "fought evil."

This self-deception is incredibly difficult to detect in ourselves. Yet without seeing it, the true reason for other people's misbehavior remains forever hidden from us, and we cannot help but exacerbate it.

If you still harbor the capacity for contempt (and I certainly do), then you are surely leaking evil into the world somewhere, somehow, in some way that you are not yet conscious of. The greatest thing you can do for the world is heal the part of you that's enabling this. Meditation, psychedelics, trauma work, shadow work, whatever. Please don't let it fester.

You don't have to take my word for it. Part of you knows this perfectly well. You only need to discover what's blocking that knowledge from being fully conscious.

## FAQ / glossary / notes

### Why do you call it a "conspiracy"?

Your actual enemy is not other people, but the evil in all of our minds—yet your evil only allows you to see it in others, thus tricking you into behaving in ways that spread it while convinced you that you're fighting it.

In this way, it behaves like an intelligent distributed organism[^distributed-organism], with shadowy tentacles embedded in each of our minds. It is leveraging humanity's intelligence to produce horrifying outcomes that nobody claims to want, yet which are the inevitable result of our collective self-deception[^conspiracy]. Nobody can see it, but everyone can sense it.

In the same way that the "evil elites" are (supposedly or actually) manipulating us to take attention off of them, this super-organism is manipulating _all_ of us to take attention off of _it._ It is the original "evil conspiracy," to which all the rest ultimately filter up—and we are its unwitting minions.

As crazy as this sounds, it can be perceived directly. In fact, as best I can tell, everyone who introspects carefully enough discovers it sooner or later (though they may use different language). But the _really_ crazy part is that it's not really "unwitting"...

### Self-deception (aka willful ignorance)

Have you ever done something that deep down you felt was wrong, but convinced yourself it was okay? Try and recall what that state is like. You knew perfectly well that what you were doing was wrong—according to your own conscience—but that knowledge was carefully hidden from conscious self-reflection. You somehow _knew_ but simultaneously _didn't_. It is a kind of schism in the mind, and it is where evil hides.

This mechanism is ultimately responsible for _all_ misbehavior. Even the most evil person could not do what they do without it, and conversely, you yourself are capable of almost anything under the right circumstances[^right-circumstances]. This is very hard to accept about ourselves, so we try to hide it—and the results are disastrous.

The more guilty we are of this, the more eagerly we seek it out in others. We then try to force them to own up to theirs, but this backfires miserably: they can sense that we are in no position to be scorning them, and so they simply return the favor.

But part of us secretly _wants_ this outcome...

### Contempt

> "When wickedness comes, so does contempt..." —Proverbs 18:3

Contempt is the feeling that you're fundamentally better than someone[^contempt]. Not just that you hold better views, or act better, but are *intrinsically* better. For example, "bad people" are fundamentally morally defective—unlike you. It's not necessarily a conscious belief, but a feeling and a perception.

There is a profound sense in which you are fundamentally the _same_ as everyone else. In fact, you _are_ everyone (and everything) "else." This isn't realized fully until enlightenment, but everyone can sense it at some level at all times. That's why certain literature[^literature] speaks to us so powerfully. Contempt is a way to hide this from yourself, and is thus self-deceptive—in exactly the same way as racism[^racism].

You may not be able to detect this in yourself, but others can sense it—even if only subconsciously. They know the game you're playing, so they can't help but see _you_ as a "bad person" and feel compelled to fight your evil in return. You act dismayed by this recalcitrance—but you were secretly _hoping_ to provoke it, because it justifies your contempt.

Consider how much more satisfying it is to watch a bad person "get owned" than to see them have a change of heart—despite the latter actually being helpful. Part of us is more than happy to throw people under the bus in order to uphold our self-image as "good people"—but this requires plausible deniability. This is why we must see them as _irredeemably_ bad: it leaves zero doubt that our malice is good.

It can be _extremely hard_ to admit (or even detect) that we're doing this, for obvious reasons. But it is not until we see exactly _why_ it's so hard that we begin to understand what prevents the "bad people" from consciously recognizing _their_ self-deception—and we can't fix what we don't understand. Until then, we can only butt heads with it, which is worse than useless.

To summarize: all evil is enabled by self-deception, which itself is rooted in misperception. Contempt is a secret attempt to induce this misperception in others—target, allies, and bystanders alike. It thereby enables more evil, regardless of who it is directed at—and part of us _needs_ this, to justify our misperception. In short: the way we perceive people becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy[^prophecy].

That is why the first step in fighting evil is confronting our own self-deception.

### Isn't it a little hyperbolic to call contempt "evil"?

Pause and notice how contempt, malice, hatred, and malevolence all have the same "flavor" or "signature." Once contempt is fully unmasked for what it is, you can literally _feel_ the malevolence—as though you are gleefully injecting evil into your target's very soul, while winking at them as if to remind them that you will get away with it. The trouble is, you ultimately won't.

It still sends a shudder down my spine to recall being forcefully shown that I was doing this—and that part of me _always_ knew.

### Inner light

The Buddhists (amongst others) believe that the fundamental nature of mind is pure compassion. But it's not just a belief: anyone with the time and desire can discover this for themselves. You can also get a taste of it on psychedelics. From this layer of mind, you can perceive that the same is true of all others, too. It's a feature of mind itself, strange as that may sound.

However, for various reasons, we lose contact with our "absolute goodness," which forces us to seek it _relatively_; that is, at the expense of others. We _need_ to see others as "bad" so that we can know ourselves as "good." This gives us an incentive to _make_ them bad. But even as we do so, part of us knows that we're doing this, so we have to hide it even harder, thus intensifying the process in a horrifying feedback loop. The worse we become, the harder it is to realize it.

In this state I _need_ evil to exist, so that I have something to fight, to prove my goodness.

Ironically, it is our memory of our original goodness that is the root cause of our misbehavior. Only by coming back into direct contact with it can we can stop contributing to this horrific cycle. That requires inner work. Evil keeps our attention fixated outward, on the evil "out there," precisely to prevent us from doing the one thing that could actually end it.

### Kindness / compassion

Compassion (which we're using interchangeably with "kindness") is the hardest word to define, but also the most important, since it is the only thing that actually fights evil.

We could say that it's acting in accordance with one's inner light. We could also say that it's being free of misperception / self-deception / malice, which amounts to the same thing. But it can be _exceptionally_ hard to detect self-deception in ourselves. In fact, the more righteous we feel, the more surely we are engaged in self-deception. Self-righteousness exists _only_ as a cover.

There are a few ways we usually get the definition wrong:

1. It does not simply mean "nice." Sometimes, being sweet and loving is the most compassionate response, and sometimes not. See the Dalai Lama quote, for example.

2. It is not about obeying some "moral principles." Reality is in constant flux, whereas principles never change. It is certainly not about _enforcing_ your principles on others, however "kind" they may be.
 
3. Hating bad people is not kind; it is evil. [Also see pseudo-kindness.]

Ultimately, it is about being radically honest with oneself. You could say that kindness is never "for" a particular person, but only ever for reality as a whole. It feels like a fierce, uncompromising love for the world. By this definition, it is _always_ the right motivation in every circumstance—though even this should not be thought of as a "principle," but as a pointer.

How does this "end evil"? By cutting through self-deception; i.e., reminding people of _their_ inner light. Yes, even shooting someone can do that under the right circumstances—though be very careful here: violence is almost always self-deception. Most situations require much more gentle reminders. Part of you always knows what you're really up to, and you _will_ have to confront it sooner or later.

### How do I know that my "inner light" knows what's best?

It doesn't. It merely ensures that you're acting with complete honesty and clean intention. You still need to learn which behaviors are helpful and harmful in which situations. This is wisdom, which compassion must be paired with to be truly effective.

### Pseudo-kindness

This is when we are cruel to one person in the name of helping another. This is cleverly-disguised evil, and is painfully common because it is somehow still socially acceptable.

For example, I am a vegetarian. I am embarrassed to admit that there was a time when I thought that contempt for non-vegetarians was good. That was pseudo-kindness.

(And on the flip side, I believe that veganism is even kinder, but have not been able to bring myself to commit fully. This is probably self-deception—though to be perfectly clear, your own compassion may point you to a different answer, and that is perfectly fine.)

I'm sure you can identify other pseudo-kind ideologies. There are many today.

### Idiot compassion

(Coined by Chogyam Trungpa.)

This is the inverse of pseudo-kindness: it is when we are _nice_ to someone in a way that enables bad behavior, because we can't bring ourselves to do the difficult but right thing.

### Impersonation

The trickiest thing about evil is that it masquerades as our light. When we are in close contact with our light, they are easy to tell apart. But each time we confuse them, it becomes progressively harder. Eventually there is no memory of the light at all, and "good" refers to some arbitrary (and secretly self-serving) principles. This is a difficult place to work your way back from.

### Does evil really exist?

> _For so long as the root of wickedness is hidden, it is strong. But when it is recognized, it is dissolved. When it is revealed, it perishes. ... It is powerful because we have not recognized it._ — The Gospel of Philip

Reality is actually one seamless interdependent whole. When we misperceive this, and attempt to separate ourselves out from it, we then behave in ways that reinforce that illusion. In a sense, evil is nothing but this process of reinforcement.

Perhaps, then, we could say that evil exists as a real misperception. What began as an innocent mistake spiraled out of control, and has taken on a seeming life of its own. It can thus be very useful to perceive evil as a distinct entity—as long as we remember that it's not separate from our own minds.

When did this "innocent mistake" begin? After all, evil clearly existed before our birth. What makes this so hard to communicate is that we're not describing not a process that began in time and space—those are constructs that our mind uses to make sense of reality once it has been (apparently) divided. This renders the "who started it" question moot. You could say we restart it in each moment of perception.

It may not be useful to get too into metaphysics here, but it can be helpful to recognize that all evil stems from the unwillingness or inability to recognize the humanity in other people; to _see_ yourself in them[^genocide]. It's actually broader than just people: destroying nature can be evil. It's a failure to recognize that what happens to the world ultimately happens to us, because in a profound and surprising sense, we _are_ the world. Harming it *always* comes back to bite us. 

Ultimately, all self-deception boils down to feigned ignorance of this fact. Again, some literature is good at reminding us of this[^literature].

### What does the evil want?

As long as we're anthropomorphizing it, we could say that it attempts to escalate toward a full-blown Armageddon, in which each side can violently prove just how righteous they are, once and for all.

This is why the US is headed toward civil war, with nobody aware of their own complicity. It is also what [leads to bitter divorces](https://www.gottman.com/blog/this-one-thing-is-the-biggest-predictor-of-divorce/), in which each side feels like the exclusive victim / hero.

### Are there really evil people?

Some beings have become so separated from their inner light that there's effectively no memory of it left, and thus no discernible desire to be "good" in any meaningful sense. (Note that by this definition, even Hitler may not qualify: he believed he was doing good for humanity; loved his dog; etc. True _malevolence_ is exceedingly rare, thankfully.) It seems fair to apply the label "evil" to such people, but there are two important caveats.

First, contempt and malice are *still* the wrong response, for exactly the same reason as before.

Second, we often use the term "evil" as a cudgel for people who are nowhere near it: from their perspective, they really are doing what they consider "good." Our political rivals are a common example. This is just a license to be cruel.

The greatest risk when confronting such evil is that it will trigger our own, as described before. I genuinely don't know what to do in such situations, but I like to remember this fact:

While it is surely true that "evil wins when good people do nothing," the only thing worse than letting evil win is secretly joining forces with it. And the greater the evil, the more likely this becomes. Again, it's not that you join their particular _brand_ of evil, but that you elicit your own.

(Also note that "good people" as used here can be problematic since it implies the existence of fundamentally "bad people.")

### You mentioned psychedelics. How can they help?

This deserves its own piece. For now, I'll just share this quote:

> *My most recent mushroom trip (also the largest dose I've ever taken) I became fixated on a news story I had heard that week. About an 8 year old girl from a tribe in the Amazon, who was [tied to a tree and burned alive](https://www.survivalinternational.org/news/8033) in order to scare her people off their land so it could be logged. I realized that at the moment he did it, whoever lit that gasoline actually felt / thought more or less okay about what he was doing. And my mind was illuminated with dozens of the parallels between that man's malformed, horrific perceptual / behavioral state, and mine. I saw the same mistakes in value attribution, the same willful ignorance of the consequences of my acts and words. And there was nothing I could do to deny the similarity.*
>
> *Reminds me of something (I think) Duncan [Trussell] said on some recent podcast, quoting somebody else: it isn't the victim of violence you have to pray for so much. It's the perpetrator. They are the one who is more trapped in delusion, more estranged from love, etc.*

You may have heard of "ego death" on psychedelics. Only by seeing beneath your apparent differences with others do you begin to see your astonishing (and sometimes horrifying) similarities.

### Near-death experiences

These can have a similar effect as psychedelics.

> I wasn’t just watching the events; I was actually reliving them again, while at the same time I was also re-experiencing the actions from other people’s points of view. I _was_ them. I was reliving the experience from their point of view and at the same time (and I don’t know how this works) I was also experiencing it from a higher reality; the truth of the matter. So what I saw was my own lies and my own self deception to myself, which I had used to convince me that doing certain things was okay because people had deserved it. Then I was experiencing the emotional impact it had on other people. I felt their pain. I felt the shock on them. At the same time I also saw that they have their own lies and self-deceptions.
>
> The result was that I felt like a failure as a person. I wasn’t the person I had thought I was. It was humiliating. I felt really dreadful and it was completely humbling.
>
> The judgment came all from myself. It was not from an outside source. But then this being that was with me was also sending me comforting messages – thank goodness! – and one of them was it was alright as I was only human.
>
> The entire experience gave me a second chance to live a more meaningful life. I felt I had a chance now to change things so that the next time I get back to the life review it wouldn’t be the same or at least they would say, “He tried.”

You _will_ have to confront your hidden misbehavior sooner or later; it doesn't just evaporate from reality. Might as well make it sooner.

### Are _you_ a saint / enlightened?

Hell no.

### Then what gives you the right to lecture me on morality?

Sorry, that's not the intent. I am a complete hypocrite and have no right to lecture anyone. I'm just sharing something I've seen, because I believe it is helpful.

### What is this crazy background image?

I made it with DALL-E 3. [Here it is](img/buddha.png).

## Other notes

- Coming into contact with your "inner light" provides the profound psychological safety required to uncover and hold the full depth of your complicity in the world. You can then offer this same gift to others—though if it still feels like there is a "you" and "others," there is work left to be done.

- I think we should popularize the idea of "herd immunity to evil." When in a contemptuous crowd or atmosphere, it is very easy to get swept up yourself. But if you're aware of this dangerous pattern and resistant to it, you provide a kind of "buffer" for others. The more people who do this, the harder it is for evil to spread.


- Even before it turns into full-blown contempt, there can be a subtle tendency to assume bad faith in a person. You feel it as a kind of hardening of your heart. This rapidly results in a downward spiral, as you subtly provoke them into confirming your suspicion. We do this _all the time_. 

    Obviously people _do_ sometimes act in bad faith, and we must protect ourselves, but it's crucial to stay alert for any budding contempt.


- Revenge fantasy films (like The Equalizer) and those "[Karens Getting Owned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88CqPl_HqS4)" YouTube videos exist only to stoke our darkness. They are a manifestation of our evil—again, masquerading as our goodness. Notice how they feel _so goddamn righteous._ That's it: that's the feeling.


- "Outrage" can mean (healthy) anger directed at correcting an injustice, but it quickly gets corrupted into self-righteous indignation. Similarly, "judgement" can refer to wise discernment, but it quickly devolves into disdain. Just like "compassion" doesn't really mean "being nice," these words get redefined by our evil so that we make a mess of what is actually quite simple.


- When you fight people using contempt, you can feel your evil allying with theirs. Conversely, when you fight them with compassion, you can feel your inner light allying with theirs. Part of them (and bystanders) can sense what's really happening, and this makes all the difference. It provides them with the safety to confront their misbehavior while not letting them off the hook for it.


- You know the classic angel and devil ont the shoulder? The angel is your inner light, and is intrinsic to you. The devil is your evil, and he doesn't just whisper bad ideas into your ear: he alters your very perception.


- "We judge ourselves by our intentions and others by their behavior" — Stephen Covey (paraphrasing the [Fundamental Attribution Error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error))

## Misc

> But some unresolved emotional issues remained. For a start, I still felt that I had been victimized by this person. I felt hurt. To resolve this, I needed to face all the things this person’s deliberate and ruthless dishonesty had stirred up within my dark side. I succeeded in doing so mainly by looking at examples of situations where I had deliberately lied. Why had I lied? How had I justified it to myself? I kept reflecting on such situations where I had been a liar. Eventually I reached the point where I could clearly see that this person had essentially been doing nothing different from me.

[^distributed-organism]: I asked ChatGPT how it would interpret this phrase. I loved its response:
    > Describing evil as a "distributed organism" suggests a conceptual metaphor where evil is likened to a living entity with multiple parts functioning cohesively but spread out over a wide area or among various systems. In this metaphor, just as an organism has many cells or systems that work together to sustain life, evil could be seen as having various components or individuals that contribute to its overall presence or influence.
    >
    >This idea implies that evil is not centralized or localized in one place or person but is instead dispersed throughout a society, group, or even within various aspects of human nature or interaction. It suggests that evil might operate through a network of actions, attitudes, and individuals, all contributing to the maintenance or spread of its effects, much like a biological organism's systems and cells contribute to its survival and functioning.
    >
    > It also can imply a sense of resilience and adaptability; just as an organism can survive damage to one part by relying on others, a "distributed organism" of evil might not be easily eradicated because its diffuse nature allows it to continue functioning even if one aspect is addressed or reformed.

[^racism]: Obviously skin color is a much more ridiculous reason to set ourselves apart than, say, moral attitudes (which we have some control over). But at the very deepest level, even those don't define us. Again, this isn't something I can prove to you, but part of you knows it. But regardless of your beliefs on this matter, it is possible to see unmistakably that it is rooted in the same desire to elevate yourself at the expense of others.

[^conspiracy]: Our cumulative self-deception effectively _compels_ the existence of evil people running the show, on whom our externalized blame can be entirely pinned. Which isn't to say that we shouldn't hold them fully responsible for their actions—just that if we do it with contempt, we are secretly instructing reality to immediately fill the shoes. All that changes is the details of their evil.

[^contempt]: To be clear, contempt for ideas or behavior can be perfectly healthy.

[^prophecy]: Obviously our own perception has only so much effect, but it is _far_ more powerful than we realize because our perception goes far deeper than we realize.

[^genocide]: Note that genocides generally start with dehumanization. The Nazis referred to Jews as 'vermin' and during the genocide in Rwanda, Tutsis were referred to as 'cockroaches.'

[^right-circumstances]: You have _no idea_ how slippery the slope to full-blown evil is. Thank your lucky stars that the right circumstances haven't manifested to send you down it. If you believe you are immune, this is the surest sign that evil has already colonized the deepest part of your mind.
