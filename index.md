title: Contempt is Evil
---

> _We are the hardware on which the Devil himself runs._

Of all the reasons not to feel contempt, none is as compelling as discovering firsthand how it's secretly the tool of a malevolent presence that has humanity firmly in its grip...

---

Imagine you witness someone misbehaving — anything from cutting in line to a full-blown atrocity.

If your mind were free of evil, you would literally see yourself in them — indeed, in everyone and everything[^literature] — and be incapable of contempt or malice. You would more easily perceive the inner and outer conditions that led to their behavior, which would enable a healthy response; one that would not amplify hostility in the world. This is called compassion — _even if it requires violence_[^dalai-lama-gun]. It _reduces_ evil.

Evil, on the other hand, alters your very perception, so that you literally see "bad person" and wish them harm. It might be as innocent as mockery or shaming[^mockery] — but however "well-intentioned," such behavior is subconsciously designed to create *more* enmity; to increase evil in the world. You are inducing the perception in them that _you_ are evil, which they now feel compelled to fight. But this fact will be cleverly hidden from you. You will come away feeling righteous; like you "fought evil."

Our evil manipulates us into provoking others' while convinced that we're fighting theirs. In this way, it almost seems like an intelligent organism living in our minds. If you step back a bit, these begin to look like the limbs of a _distributed_ organism, communicating with itself through the vast network of human minds, leveraging our collective intelligence to keep itself alive and growing.

You know the archetypal "evil conspiracy" that is said to be running the world behind the scenes, without anyone ever detecting it? Well _this is it_ — the _primordial_ evil conspiracy, to which all the rest ultimately filter up[^cabal]. Only this one is not run by a select group of evil people, but by the evil in _all of our minds together_. **We** are the hardware on which the Devil himself[^devil] runs.

What does it feel like when this sinister entity is trying to take control of your mind? _It feels like contempt._ It's not always as extreme as hating "evil people." It often begins with a subtle disdain, which grows via a self-reinforcing process into hatred, malice, and beyond. The further along you get, the more you will license yourself to behave in ways that you would rightfully condemn in others.

This is a form of self-deception. A deep part of you knows this, but it's somehow not accessible to conscious self-reflection. Until you see how this operates in yourself, it is impossible to understand exactly what enables the evil in others. And you cannot fix what you don't understand. Until then, you cannot help but spread evil even as you're convinced you're fighting it.

This is its core trick. It keeps your attention fixated outward on the evil "out there," so that you never turn inward to discover its secret, which would enable you to actually heal it, first in yourself, and then others. Your true enemy is not other people; it is the evil in all of our minds. Contempt is how it keeps itself continually nourished and hidden.

If you still harbor the capacity for contempt, then you are certainly leaking evil into the world somewhere, somehow, in some way that you are not yet conscious of. The greatest gift you can give the world is heal the part of you that's enabling this. Meditation, psychedelics, trauma work, shadow work, whatever. Please don't let it fester.

This is not just a wild theory: as best I can tell, everyone who introspects carefully enough eventually perceives it. You don't have to take my word for it. Part of you knows all of this perfectly well. You only need to discover what's blocking that knowledge from being fully conscious.

[^devil]: I don't mean this literally, but it also shouldn't be taken too lightly. Of interest may be the fact that it aligns with certain interpretations of the Judeo-Christian tradition, in which the Devil isn't evil but merely a tempter, and Hell isn't a place but your experience of wandering far away from the Light of God. If you ignore your conscience for long enough, you will indeed experience Hell.

[^dalai-lama-gun]: The Dalai Lama was once asked what you should do if a gunman is trying to shoot you and you have a gun. [He said "shoot back."](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/)

[^cabal]: I'm not denying that there may be groups of "evil" people who conspire to cause great harm. I'm saying that their existence wouldn't be possible if the rest of us weren't feeding the source (and conversely, it is _inevitable_ given that we are).

The people that died in the collapse. Me again. Every single person who ever paid money for a Pet Rock? Me. I don’t mean I identify with them or sympathize with them. I mean I _am_ them. It’s impossible to explain any more clearly than that, but this isn’t a figure of speech or bad poetry. I mean it absolutely literally.

[^mockery]: There is a subtlety here: just like with violence, mocking or shaming *can* sometimes be the right response. But they work (and feel) entirely differently when not motivated by contempt. I think of these as advanced techniques, because it's so easy to fool oneself.
