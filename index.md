title: Contempt is Evil
---

Evil's greatest trick is to convince you that it doesn't exist within your own mind; or if it does, that it exists to fight the evil "out there." This lie is responsible for the horror you see around you today.

---

Imagine you witness an atrocity. If your mind were free of evil, you would feel absolutely no malice. You would more easily perceive the (inner and outer) conditions that led to the person being able to do this, which would enable a more effective response; one that would not amplify hostility in the world. This is called compassion—_even if it requires violence_[^dalai-lama-gun]. It reduces evil.

Evil alters your very perception, so that you literally see "bad person" and wish to cause harm. It might be as "innocent" as mockery or shaming[^mockery], but however "well-intentioned," such behavior is subconsciously designed to create *more* enmity and suffering; to increase evil in the world. This fact will be cleverly hidden from you. You will come away feeling righteous; like you "fought evil."

This self-deception is extremely difficult to detect in ourselves. Yet without uncovering it, the true reason for other people's misbehavior stays hidden from us, and we cannot help but exacerbate it. Evil is *insanely* clever: it knows exactly how to manipulate our minds so that we eagerly spread it without ever suspecting it.

If you still harbor the tendency for contempt (and I certainly do), then you are surely leaking evil into the world somewhere, somehow, and hiding it from yourself. The best thing you can do for the world is heal the part of you that's enabling this. Meditation, psychedelics, trauma work, shadow work, whatever. Please don't let it fester.

You don't have to take my word for it. Part of you knows this perfectly well. You only need to discover what's blocking that knowledge from being fully conscious.

## FAQ / glossary / notes

### Why do you call it "insanely clever"?

Your actual enemy is not other people, but the "evil" in their minds—yet it gets us to be nasty to each other and thereby strengthen it, while feeling flawlessly convinced that we're fighting it.

From a certain perspective, evil behaves like an intelligent distributed organism, with shadowy tentacles embedded in each of our minds. It is the original "evil conspiracy," to which all the rest ultimately owe their existence—and we are its unwitting minions. As crazy as this sounds, it can be perceived directly. In fact, as best I can tell, everyone who introspects carefully enough discovers it sooner or later.

But the _really_ crazy part is that we're not entirely "unwitting"...

### Self-deception (aka willful ignorance)

Have you ever done something that deep down you felt was wrong, but convinced yourself it was okay? Try and recall what that state is like. You knew perfectly well that what you were doing was wrong (according to your own conscience), but that knowledge was carefully hidden from conscious self-reflection. You somehow _knew_ but also _didn't_. It is a kind of schism in the mind.

This mechanism is ultimately responsible for _all_ misbehavior. Even the most "evil" person could not do what they do without it, and conversely, you yourself are capable of almost anything under the right circumstances. This is very hard to accept about ourselves, so we try to hide it—and the results are disastrous.

The more guilty we are of doing this ourselves, the more eagerly we seek it out in others. We then try to force them to own up to theirs, but this backfires miserably: they can sense that we don't have the moral authority to do such a thing, and they just double down.

But part of us secretly _wants_ this outcome...

### Contempt

> "When wickedness comes, so does contempt..." —Proverbs 18:3

Contempt (for a person) is the feeling that you're fundamentally better than someone. Not just that you hold better views, or act better, but are *intrinsically* better. For example, you see "bad people" as fundamentally morally defective—unlike you. It's not necessarily a conscious belief, but a feeling.

There is a profound sense in which you are fundamentally the _same_ as everyone else [see "inner light"]. This isn't realized fully until enlightenment, but everyone can sense it at some level at all times. That's why certain literature [^literature] speaks to us so powerfully. Contempt is a way to hide this fact from yourself, and is thus self-deceptive.

You may not be able to detect it in yourself, but others can—even if only subconsciously. They know the game you're playing, so they can't help but see _you_ as a "bad person" and feel compelled to fight your evil in return. You act dismayed by this recalcitrance, but you were secretly _intending_ to provoke it, because it proves your superiority and licenses righteous escalation.

Think about how much more satisfying it is to watch a bad person "get owned" than to see them have a change of heart—despite the latter actually being helpful. We are perfectly happy to darken the world if it gives us a hit of self-righteousness—provided we have plausible deniability. We convince ourselves that people are irredeemable precisely to justify our malice.

It can be _extremely hard_ to admit that we're doing this, for obvious reasons. But it is not until we see exactly _why_ it's so hard that we begin to understand what prevents the "bad people" from consciously recognizing _their_ self-deception—and we can't fix what we don't understand. Until then, we can only butt heads with it, which is worse than useless.

That's why the first step in fighting evil is confronting our own self-deception.

### Isn't it a little hyperbolic to call contempt "evil"?

Pause and notice how contempt, malice, hatred, and malevolence all have the same "flavor" or "signature." Once contempt is fully unmasked for what it is, you can literally _feel_ the malevolence—as though you are gleefully injecting evil into their very soul, while winking at them as if to remind them that you will get away with it. The trouble is, you ultimately won't.

It still sends a shudder down my spine to recall being forcefully shown how I was doing this. Even just sitting around encouraging contempt in my "allies" is evil.

### Inner light

The Buddhists (amongst others) believe that the fundamental nature of mind is pure compassion. But it's not just a belief: anyone with the time and desire can discover this for themselves. You can also get a taste of it on psychedelics. From this layer of mind, you can perceive that the same is true of all others, too. It's a feature of mind itself, strange as that may sound.

However, for various reasons, we lose contact with our "absolute goodness," which forces us to seek it _relatively_; that is, at the expense of others. We _need_ to see others as "bad" so that we can know ourselves as "good." This gives us an incentive to _make_ them bad. But even as we do so, part of us knows that we're doing this, so we have to hide it even harder, thus intensifying the process in a horrifying feedback loop.

In this state I _need_ evil to exist, so that I have something to fight, to prove my goodness.

Ironically, then, it is our memory of our original goodness that is the root cause of our misbehavior. Only by coming back into direct contact with it can we can stop contributing to this horrific cycle.

### Are there really evil people?

Some beings have become so separated from their inner light that there's effectively no memory of it left, and thus no discernible desire to be "good" in any meaningful sense. (Note that by this definition, even Hitler may not qualify: he believed he was doing good for humanity; loved his dog; etc. True _malevolence_ is exceedingly rare, thankfully.) It seems fair to apply the label "evil" to such people, but there are two important caveats.

First, contempt and malice are *still* the wrong response, for exactly the same reason as before.

Second, we often use the term "evil" as a cudgel for people who are nowhere near it: from their perspective, they really are doing what they consider "good." Our political rivals are a common example. This is just a license to be cruel.

The greatest risk when confronting such evil is that it will trigger our own, as described before. I genuinely don't know what to do in such situations, but I like to remember this fact:

While it is surely true that "evil wins when good people do nothing," the only thing worse than letting evil win is secretly joining forces with it. And the greater the evil, the more likely this becomes. Again, it's not that you join their particular _brand_ of evil, but that you elicit your own.

(Also note that "good people" as used here can be problematic since it implies the existence of fundamentally "bad people.")

### Kindness / compassion

Compassion (which we're using interchangeably with "kindness") is the hardest word to define, but also the most important, since it is the only thing that actually fights evil.

We could say that it's acting in accordance with one's inner light. We could also say that it's being free of self-deception (and thus of malice), which amounts to the same thing. But it can be _exceptionally_ hard to detect self-deception in ourselves, which is what makes it so challenging. Many of our deeply-held moral convictions turn out to be self-deceptive in the final analysis.

There are two ways we usually get the definition wrong:

1. It does not simply mean "nice," or even sympathizing. Sometimes, being sweet and loving is the most compassionate response, and sometimes not. See the Dalai Lama quote, for example.

2. Hating bad people is not kind; it is _evil_. [Also see pseudo-kindness.]

By this definition, kindness is _always_ the right motivation in every circumstance. You could say that kindness is never "for" a particular person, but only ever for reality as a whole.

How does this "end evil"? By cutting through self-deception; i.e., reminding people of _their_ inner light. Yes, even shooting someone can do that under the right circumstances—though be very careful here: the less loving the response, the more likely it is really self-deception. Part of you knows the truth, and you _will_ have to confront it sooner or later.

### Pseudo-kindness

This is when we are cruel (i.e., contemptuous, malicious, etc.) to one person in the name of helping another. This is cleverly-disguised evil.

For example, I am a vegetarian. I am embarrassed to admit that there was a time when I thought that contempt for non-vegetarians was good. That was pseudo-kindness.

(And on the flip side, I believe that veganism is even kinder, but have not been able to bring myself to commit fully. This is probably self-deception—though to be perfectly clear, your own compassion may point you to a different answer, and that is perfectly fine.)

I'm sure you can identify other pseudo-kind ideologies. There are many today.

### Idiot compassion

(Coined by Chogyam Trungpa.)

This is the inverse of pseudo-kindness: it is when we are _nice_ to someone in a way that enables bad behavior, because we can't bring ourselves to do the difficult but right thing.

### Does evil really exist?

> _For so long as the root of wickedness is hidden, it is strong. But when it is recognized, it is dissolved. When it is revealed, it perishes. ... It is powerful because we have not recognized it._ — The Gospel of Philip

Reality is actually one seamless interdependent whole. When we misperceive this, and attempt to separate ourselves out from it, we then behave in ways that reinforce that illusion. In a sense, evil is nothing but this process of reinforcement.

Perhaps, then, we could say that evil exists as a real misperception. What began as an innocent mistake spiraled out of control, and has taken on a seeming life of its own. It can thus be very useful to perceive evil as a distinct entity—as long as we remember that it's not separate from our own minds.

When did this "innocent mistake" begin? After all, evil clearly existed before our birth. What makes this so hard to communicate is that we're not describing not a process that began in time and space—those are only constructs that our mind uses to make sense of reality once it has been (apparently) divided. This renders the "who started it" question moot.

It may not be useful to get too into metaphysics here, but it can be helpful to recognize that all evil stems from the unwillingness or inability to recognize the humanity in other people; to _see_ yourself in them. It's actually broader than just people: destroying nature can be evil. It's a failure to recognize that what happens to the world ultimately happens to us, because in a profound and surprising sense, we _are_ the world. Harming it *always* comes back to bite us. 
Ultimately, all self-deception boils down to feigned ignorance of this fact.

Again, some literature is good at reminding us[^literature].

### What does the evil want?

As long as we're anthropomorphizing it, we could say that it always attempts to escalate toward a full-blown Armageddon, in which each side can violently prove just how righteous they are, once and for all.

This is why the US is headed toward civil war, with nobody aware of their own complicity. It is what leads to bitter divorces, in which each side feels like the exclusive victim / hero.

### You mentioned psychedelics. How can they help?

This deserves its own piece. For now, I'll just share this quote:

> *My most recent mushroom trip (also the largest dose I've ever taken) I became fixated on a news story I had heard that week. About an 8 year old girl from a tribe in the Amazon, who was [tied to a tree and burned alive](https://www.survivalinternational.org/news/8033) in order to scare her people off their land so it could be logged. I realized that at the moment he did it, whoever lit that gasoline actually felt / thought more or less okay about what he was doing. And my mind was illuminated with dozens of the parallels between that man's malformed, horrific perceptual / behavioral state, and mine. I saw the same mistakes in value attribution, the same willful ignorance of the consequences of my acts and words. And there was nothing I could do to deny the similarity.*
>
> *Reminds me of something (I think) Duncan [Trussell] said on some recent podcast, quoting somebody else: it isn't the victim of violence you have to pray for so much. It's the perpetrator. They are the one who is more trapped in delusion, more estranged from love, etc.*

Coming into contact with your "inner light" provides the profound psychological safety required to uncover and hold the full depth of your complicity in the world. You can then offer this same gift to others—though if it still feels like there is a "you" and "others," there is work left to be done.

### Say more about this "conspiracy"

This is really hard to describe. You know those "evil elites" who are responsible for the world's ills? The ones who are playing us regular folks off each other to take attention off of them? What's actually happening is that _evil_ is playing us off of them, too, to take attention off of _it_. They're ultimately minions of the same collective darkness that we are.

Our own self-deception _compels_ their existence, so that we can offload our own burden. Which isn't to say that we shouldn't hold them fully responsible for their actions—just that if we do it with contempt, part of us is secretly installing someone new to fill the shoes they leave empty. All that changes is the details of their evil.

### Near-death experiences

These can have a similar effect as psychedelics.

> I wasn’t just watching the events; I was actually reliving them again, while at the same time I was also re-experiencing the actions from other people’s points of view. I _was_ them. I was reliving the experience from their point of view and at the same time (and I don’t know how this works) I was also experiencing it from a higher reality; the truth of the matter. So what I saw was my own lies and my own self deception to myself, which I had used to convince me that doing certain things was okay because people had deserved it. Then I was experiencing the emotional impact it had on other people. I felt their pain. I felt the shock on them. At the same time I also saw that they have their own lies and self-deceptions.
>
> The result was that I felt like a failure as a person. I wasn’t the person I had thought I was. It was humiliating. I felt really dreadful and it was completely humbling.
>
> The judgment came all from myself. It was not from an outside source. But then this being that was with me was also sending me comforting messages – thank goodness! – and one of them was it was alright as I was only human.
>
> The entire experience gave me a second chance to live a more meaningful life. I felt I had a chance now to change things so that the next time I get back to the life review it wouldn’t be the same or at least they would say, “He tried.”

You _will_ have to confront your hidden misbehavior sooner or later; it doesn't just evaporate from reality. Might as well make it sooner.

### Are _you_ a saint / enlightened?

Hell no.

### Then what gives you the right to lecture me on morality?

Sorry, that's not the intent. I am a complete hypocrite and have no right to lecture anyone. I'm just sharing something I've seen, because I believe it is helpful.

## Other notes

- Even before it turns into full-blown contempt, there can be a subtle tendency to assume bad faith in a person. You feel it as a kind of hardening of your heart. This rapidly results in a downward spiral, as you subtly provoke them into confirming your suspicion. We do this _all the time_. 

    Obviously people _do_ sometimes act in bad faith, and we must protect ourselves, but it's crucial to stay alert for any budding contempt.


- Revenge fantasy films (like The Equalizer) and those "[Karens Getting Owned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88CqPl_HqS4)" YouTube videos exist only to stoke our darkness. They are a manifestation of our evil—again, masquerading as our goodness. Notice how they feel _so goddamn righteous._ That's it: that's the feeling.


- "Outrage" can mean (healthy) anger directed at correcting an injustice, but it quickly gets corrupted into self-righteous indignation. Similarly, "judgement" can refer to wise discernment, but it quickly devolves into disdain. Just like "compassion" doesn't really mean "being nice," these words get redefined by our evil so that we make a mess of what is actually quite simple.


- When you fight people using contempt, you can feel your evil allying with theirs. Conversely, when you fight them with compassion, you can feel your inner light allying with theirs. Part of them (and bystanders) can sense what's really happening, and this makes all the difference. It provides them with the safety to confront their misbehavior while not letting them off the hook for it.


- You have _no idea_ how slippery the slope to full-blown evil is. Thank your lucky stars that you haven't been given the right circumstances to manifest it. If you believe you are immune, this is the surest sign that evil has already colonized the deepest part of your mind.


- This will be obvious by now, but hating bad people is not a sign of the good within us; it's a sign of the evil.


- "We judge ourselves by our intentions and others by their behavior" — Stephen Covey (paraphrasing the [Fundamental Attribution Error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error))

## Misc

> But some unresolved emotional issues remained. For a start, I still felt that I had been victimized by this person. I felt hurt. To resolve this, I needed to face all the things this person’s deliberate and ruthless dishonesty had stirred up within my dark side. I succeeded in doing so mainly by looking at examples of situations where I had deliberately lied. Why had I lied? How had I justified it to myself? I kept reflecting on such situations where I had been a liar. Eventually I reached the point where I could clearly see that this person had essentially been doing nothing different from me.

[^mockery]: There is a subtlety here: just like with violence, mocking or shaming *can* sometimes be the best response. But they work (and feel) entirely differently when not motivated by evil. I think of these as advanced techniques, because it's so easy to fool oneself.
